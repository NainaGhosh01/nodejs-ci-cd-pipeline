# CI/CD Pipeline for Node.js Application with Jenkins, Docker, and Kubernetes

This project demonstrates a complete CI/CD pipeline for deploying a Node.js application using Jenkins, Docker, and Kubernetes. The pipeline automates the process of building, testing, creating Docker images, and deploying them to a Kubernetes cluster.

üõ†Ô∏è Tools & Technologies Used
‚Ä¢	Jenkins: For Continuous Integration (CI) to automate the build and testing process.
‚Ä¢	Docker: For containerizing the Node.js application and deploying it to Kubernetes.
‚Ä¢	Kubernetes: For orchestrating the deployment of the Node.js application.
‚Ä¢	Slack: For sending notifications on pipeline success or failure.
‚Ä¢	GitHub: For source code version control.

üìã Prerequisites
Before you begin, ensure you have the following:
1.	Jenkins installed with necessary plugins: Git, Pipeline, Docker, Slack Notification.
2.	A Docker Hub account and Docker Hub credentials in Jenkins for pushing Docker images.
3.	A Kubernetes cluster with kubectl configured to interact with the cluster.
4.	A Slack account and webhook URL configured in Jenkins for notifications.
5.	A GitHub repository containing the Node.js application.
   
üöÄ How It Works
This CI/CD pipeline automatically:
1.	Checks out the latest code from the GitHub repository.
2.	Installs dependencies using npm install.
3.	Runs unit tests with npm test, sending notifications if tests fail.
4.	Builds a Docker image for the application.
5.	Pushes the Docker image to Docker Hub.
6.	Deploys the application to a Kubernetes cluster using a dynamic deployment YAML file.
7.	Sends Slack notifications on pipeline success or failure.
   
üìã Breakdown of Pipeline Stages
1)	Checkout Code
This stage pulls the latest code from the main branch of your GitHub repository:
git branch: 'main', url: 'https://github.com/NainaGhosh01/nodejs-ci-cd-pipeline'

2)	Install Dependencies
The pipeline installs the necessary dependencies using npm:
sh 'npm install'

3)	Run Tests
This stage runs unit tests using npm test. If the tests fail, it sends a Slack notification and aborts the pipeline:
sh 'npm test'

4)	Build Docker Image
The pipeline builds a Docker image for the application with a unique version tag based on the build number: 
dockerImage = docker.build("${appRegistry}:${env.BUILD_NUMBER}")

5)	Push Docker Image
This stage pushes the built Docker image to Docker Hub:
docker.withRegistry('', registryCredential) {
dockerImage.push("${env.BUILD_NUMBER}")
dockerImage.push("latest")
}

6)	Deploy to Kubernetes
The pipeline generates a dynamic Kubernetes deployment YAML file for the application and applies it to the Kubernetes cluster.
It ensures the application is deployed with two replicas:
writeFile file: 'k8s-deployment.yaml', text:

"""
apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: Deployment
metadata:
name: nodejs-app
spec:
replicas: 2
selector:
matchLabels:
app: nodejs-app
template:
metadata:
labels:
app: nodejs-app
spec:
containers:
-	name: nodejs-container
image: ${appRegistry}:latest
ports:
-	containerPort: 3000
  
---
apiVersion: v1
kind: Service
metadata:
name: nodejs-app-service
spec:
selector:
app: nodejs-app
ports:
-	protocol: TCP
port: 80
targetPort: 3000
type: LoadBalancer
"""

sh """
export KUBECONFIG=${kubeConfig}
kubectl apply -f k8s-deployment.yaml
"""

7)	Slack Notifications
The pipeline sends notifications to a Slack channel on the success or failure of the deployment: slackSend channel: '#deployments', color: '#36a64f', message: message, webhookToken: slackWebhook

8)	Cleanup Workspace
The workspace is cleaned up after each build to ensure no unnecessary files are left behind:
cleanWs()

üìù Setup Instructions
1.	Clone the Repository:
     -git clone https://github.com/NainaGhosh01/nodejs-ci-cd-pipeline
     -cd nodejs-app
2.	Set Up Jenkins:
     -Install Jenkins with the necessary plugins: Git, Pipeline, Docker, Slack Notification.
     -Create Jenkins credentials for Docker Hub, Kubernetes kubeconfig, and Slack webhook.
3.	Configure Kubernetes Cluster:
     -Ensure your Kubernetes cluster is set up and accessible from Jenkins.
     -Install kubectl and configure it with the necessary credentials.
4.	Set Up Slack Notifications:
     -Create a Slack Webhook URL and configure it in Jenkins credentials as slack-webhook-url.
5.	Configure the Pipeline:
     -Set the GitHub repository URL in the Jenkinsfile.
     -Set up Docker Hub credentials and Kubernetes kubeconfig.
6.	Run the Pipeline:
     -Trigger the pipeline manually or set up a webhook to trigger on code push.
  	
üîß How to Run Locally (Optional)
To test this pipeline locally with Docker and Kubernetes, follow these steps:
1)	Build the Docker image: docker build -t your-dockerhub-username/nodejs-app:latest .
2)	Push to DockerHub: docker push your-dockerhub-username/nodejs-app:latest
3)	Deploy to Kubernetes: kubectl apply -f k8s-deployment.yaml
